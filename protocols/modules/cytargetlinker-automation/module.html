<h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
	<li>CyTargetLinker provides a quick and extensive enrichment of biological networks in Cytoscape</li>
	<li>The visualization options allow biological interpretation of complex regulatory networks in a graphical way</li>
	<li>In this tutorial a step-by-step explanation is given on how to extend a list of microRNAs with predicted and validated microRNA-target interactions (MTIs)</li>

<h1>Step 1a: Import a set of microRNAs into Cytoscape</h1>
<img plain src="modules/cytargetlinker-tutorial/Import-microRNA.png" style="width:50%">
<ul style="width:45%">
	<li>First you will need to create a biological network in Cytoscape 3.0 and higher containing your microRNAs of interest.</li>
	<li>The datafile should contain at least two columns, (i) the microRNA name and (ii) the corresponding miRBase accession number.</li>
	<li>An example datafile, in which two microRNAs known to be involved in obesity are listed, can be found <a href="http://projects.bigcat.unimaas.nl/data/cytargetlinker/resources/microRNAs.xlsx"  microRNA>here</a> </li>
	<li>Open the datafile containing the microRNAs in Cytoscape via File -> Import -> Network ->File.</li>
	<li>First you select the file that you want to load into Cytoscape. Thereafter, a panel becomes visible were you should select the microRNA names as Source Nodes and miRBase acc-number as Source Node Attribute, as shown on your right.</li>
</ul>
